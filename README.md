# DBMS2 PHP Project

## Database Connection
This project requires a `db_connect.php` file for the database connection.

We have included a sample file:
- `db_connect_dummy.php` â†’ contains placeholder values.

To use it:
1. Copy `db_connect_dummy.php` and rename it to `db_connect.php`
2. Update it with your actual database credentials:
   - `$servername = "localhost";`
   - `$username = "root";`
   - `$password = "";`
   - `$database = "dbms2";`
